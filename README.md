# VisionAI

## Inspiration  
We wanted to make reading and understanding online content effortless for everyone , especially individuals with **ADHD** and the **visually impaired**. Many people struggle to stay focused on long articles or navigate complex web pages. Our goal was to create an inclusive, accessible tool that helps users process information quickly and efficiently without cognitive overload.

## What it does  
**VisionAI** is an all-in-one Chrome extension that instantly **summarizes**, **translates**, and **reads text aloud** , all from within your browser. With simple **keyboard shortcuts** and **hover controls**, users can condense long content, listen to it in natural-sounding speech, or translate it into multiple languages in seconds.  
Designed for accessibility, VisionAI enhances focus, comprehension, and productivity for everyone.

## How we built it  
We built VisionAI using **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and **Chrome Extension APIs** for seamless browser integration.  
We used **APIs including Prompt API, Summarizer API,Translator API** and **text-to-speech engines** for natural voice output.  
Accessibility features were implemented, ensuring smooth interaction through keyboard navigation and hover activation.

## Challenges we ran into  
One major challenge was optimizing AI performance while keeping the extension lightweight and fast.  
We also faced difficulties ensuring compatibility across different websites and managing accessibility for screen readers.  
Balancing simplicity with advanced features like simultaneous summarize-and-translate required careful design and testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We’re proud to have created an inclusive AI tool that bridges accessibility and productivity.  
VisionAI empowers users with **ADHD**, **visual impairments**, and diverse learning needs to understand information effortlessly.  
We also succeeded in making it intuitive, fast, and privacy-focused , no data tracking, just pure assistance.

## What we learned  
We learned the importance of **user-centered design** in accessibility tech , small features like keyboard shortcuts or hover triggers can make a huge difference.  
We also gained valuable insights into AI integration within browser environments and how to optimize for real-time processing.

## What's next for VisionAI  
Next, we plan to add **offline functionality**, **custom voice and language preferences**, and **AI-powered note-taking** for deeper learning support.  
We also aim to collaborate with accessibility organizations to refine VisionAI’s experience for **neurodivergent** and **visually impaired** communities.
